# Containerization Preview Terms of Use

These terms of use apply only to the containerization preview.

This preview is made available to you on the condition that you agree to the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) which supplement [your agreement](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/) governing use of Azure. 

The preview, including its user interface, features and documentation is confidential and proprietary to Microsoft and its suppliers. For five (5) years after access of this service or its commercial release, whichever is first, you may not disclose confidential information to third parties. You may disclose confidential information only to your employees and consultants who need to know the information. You must have written agreements with them that protect the confidential information at least as much as these terms. Your duty to protect confidential information survives these terms. 

You may disclose confidential information in response to a judicial or governmental order. You must first give written notice to Microsoft to allow it to seek a protective order or otherwise protect the information. Confidential information does not include information that (i) becomes publicly known through no wrongful act; (ii) you received from a third party who did not breach confidentiality obligations to Microsoft or its suppliers; or (iii) you developed independently.

If you give feedback about the preview to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose. You will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties because Microsoft includes your feedback in them. These rights survive these terms.
